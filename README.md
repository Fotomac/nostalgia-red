# Pokémon Tri-Color Nostalgia Series

This is based on the [**Pokémon Red disassembly**][pokered]

It builds the following roms:

* Pokemon Red
* Pokemon Green
* Pokemon Blue

It's also an update of all three, with bug fixes and new features. It's still a work in progress, but there's still potential.

The current version is v10.0.3 (Summer of Adventure)

To set up the repository, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md). Also see the main Pokered repository for more information.

Special thanks to BettyNewbie, _Crystal, DarioEMeloD, MadameFrog, Mateo, and others.
